Frontend: Built with React + Vite featuring a Neon Dark theme and responsive layouts. Key functionalities include:

Drag-and-drop file uploads and column previews

Target variable selection with automatic detection

Interactive dashboard presenting dataset metrics (rows, columns, data cleanliness)

Visualizations including scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps

Suggested ML models with reasoning and insights

Key Features

Automated Machine Learning Guidance: Provides recommendations tailored to the dataset’s characteristics.

Data Quality & Health Monitoring: Detects class imbalance and evaluates overall dataset health.

Scalable Performance: Optimized to handle large datasets efficiently with lazy loading, smooth animations, and polished UI elements.

User-Centric Interface: Intuitive dashboards and interactive visualizations for seamless data exploration.

Benefits
